## DNS forwarding

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="systemd-resolved" group="systemd-resolved">

You can use the [`systemd-resolved`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/resolved/) service to resolve local application names in your network. To use the service, configure `systemd-resolved` to send `.consul` domain queries to Consul by creating `consul.conf` file located in the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/ directory.

<Note>

 PTR record queries will still be sent out to the other configured resolvers, in addition to Consul.

</Note>

After creating the resolved configuration, restart `systemd-resolved`.

```shell-session
# systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

### Validate the systemd-resolved configuration

Validate that systemd-resolved has restarted and is configured to forward
queries to Consul.

```shell-session hideClipboard
# systemctl is-active systemd-resolved
active

# resolvectl domain
Global: ~consul
Link 2 (eth0):

# resolvectl query consul.service.consul
consul.service.consul: 127.0.0.1

-- Information acquired via protocol DNS in 6.6ms.
-- Data is authenticated: no
```

Confirm that `/etc/resolv.conf` points to the `stub-resolv.conf` file managed by
systemd-resolved, and that the IP address for systemd-resolved's stub resolver
is the configured `nameserver`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1-2,4,21">

```shell-session
$ ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 37 Aug 20 22:50 /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.
#
# This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the
# internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all
# configured search domains.
#
# Run "resolvectl status" to see details about the uplink DNS servers
# currently in use.
#
# Third party programs must not access this file directly, but only through the
# symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a different way,
# replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.
#
# See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of
# operation for /etc/resolv.conf.

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Ensure that the operating system can resolve DNS queries to the `.consul` domain.

```shell-session
$ host consul.service.consul
consul.service.consul has address 127.0.0.1
```

### Using any local resolver with systemd

By default, the local resolver stub in the `resolved.conf` file is configured to listen for UDP and TCP requests at 127.0.0.53:53, but you can set the `DNSStubListener` option to `false`, which disables the stub. As a result, your system will be able to use any DNS configuration as long as it loads earlier than `resolved`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/systemd/resolved.conf">

```plaintext
DNSStubListener=false
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Disabling the local resolver stub can also solve other DNS configuration issues.

<Tab heading="BIND" group="bind">

In this example, BIND and Consul are running on the same machine.

<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
 </Note>
 
First, disable DNSSEC so that Consul and [BIND](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/) can communicate. The following example shows a BIND configuration with DNSSEC disabled.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/named.conf">

```plaintext
options {
  listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
  listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
  directory       "/var/named";
  dump-file       "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db";
  statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt";
  memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt";
  allow-query     { localhost; };
  recursion yes;

  dnssec-enable no;
  dnssec-validation no;

  /* Path to ISC DLV key */
  bindkeys-file "/etc/named.iscdlv.key";

  managed-keys-directory "/var/named/dynamic";
};

include "/etc/named/consul.conf";
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Zone file

Next, set up a zone for your Consul managed records in `consul.conf`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/named/consul.conf">

```dns-zone-file
zone "consul" IN {
  type forward;
  forward only;
  forwarders { 127.0.0.1 port 8600; };
};
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="dnsmasq" group="dnsmasq">

<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

[Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is typically configured via a `dnsmasq.conf` or a series of files in
the `/etc/dnsmasq.d` directory. Add the following settings to your dnsmasq configuration file
(e.g., `/etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul`):

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul">

```plaintext
# Enable forward lookup of the 'consul' domain:
server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600

# Uncomment and modify as appropriate to enable reverse DNS lookups for
# common netblocks found in RFC 1918, 5735, and 6598:
#rev-server=0.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=10.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=100.64.0.0/10,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=127.0.0.1/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=169.254.0.0/16,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=172.16.0.0/12,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=192.168.0.0/16,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=224.0.0.0/4,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=240.0.0.0/4,127.0.0.1#8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Restart the `dnsmasq` service after creating the configuration.

You can configure additional settings in `dnsmasq` that may be useful in your environments. See
[`dnsmasq(8)`](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html)
for additional details.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/dnsmasq.conf">

```plaintext
# Accept DNS queries only from hosts whose address is on a local subnet.
#local-service

# Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.
#no-poll

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command
# line or the dnsmasq configuration file (see the "server" directive below).
#no-resolv

# Specify IP address(es) of other DNS servers for queries not handled
# directly by consul. There is normally one 'server' entry set for every
# 'nameserver' parameter found in '/etc/resolv.conf'. See dnsmasq(8)'s
# 'server' configuration option for details.
#server=1.2.3.4
#server=208.67.222.222
#server=8.8.8.8

# Set the size of dnsmasq's cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the
# cache size to zero disables caching.
#cache-size=65536

<Tab heading="Unbound" group="unbound">

<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

[Unbound](https://www.unbound.net/) is typically configured in a `unbound.conf` file or a series of files in
the `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d` directory. Add the following settings to your Unbound configuration file
(e.g., `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/consul.conf`):

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/consul.conf">

```plaintext
#Allow insecure queries to local resolvers
server:
  do-not-query-localhost: no
  domain-insecure: "consul"

#Add consul as a stub-zone
stub-zone:
  name: "consul"
  stub-addr: 127.0.0.1@8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You may have to add the following line to the bottom of your
`/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` file for the new configuration to be included.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/unbound/unbound.conf">

```plaintext
include: "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/*.conf"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>

<Tab heading="iptables" group="iptables">

The rules must be set on the same host as the Consul instance. Relay hosts _should not_ be on the same host, otherwise the redirects will intercept the traffic.

On Linux systems that support it, incoming requests and requests to
the local host can use [`iptables`](http://www.netfilter.org/) to forward to ports on the same machine
without using a secondary service. The [`recursors`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#recursors) flag is especially important for resolving other domains with `iptables`.
This is because Consul only resolves the `.consul` TLD by default.
Recursors should not include the local host address because the `iptables` redirects would intercept the requests.

The `iptables` method is suitable for situations where an external DNS
service is already running in your infrastructure and is used as the
recursor. It is also a suitable method if you want to use an existing DNS server as your query
endpoint and forward requests for the `consul` domain to the Consul
server. In both cases, you may want to query the Consul server without the overhead of running a separate service on the Consul host.

```shell-session
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="macOS" group="macOS">

On macOS systems, you can use the macOS system resolver to point all `.consul` requests to Consul.
Documentation for this feature is available via: `man 5 resolver`.
You must add a resolver entry in `/etc/resolver/` to point at Consul. If you do not have this folder, create it.
To configure a resolver entry, you will need sudo/root access. Create a new file `/etc/resolver/consul`,
and add the following text to the file:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/resolver/consul">

```plaintext
nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The configuration informs the macOS resolver daemon to forward all `.consul` TLD requests to 127.0.0.1 on port 8600.
