# DNS Forwarding with BIND

Test content

## Background

## Requirements

## DNS forwarding



In this example, BIND and Consul are running on the same machine.

<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
 </Note>
 
First, disable DNSSEC so that Consul and [BIND](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/) can communicate. The following example shows a BIND configuration with DNSSEC disabled.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/named.conf">

```plaintext
options {
  listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
  listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
  directory       "/var/named";
  dump-file       "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db";
  statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt";
  memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt";
  allow-query     { localhost; };
  recursion yes;

  dnssec-enable no;
  dnssec-validation no;

  /* Path to ISC DLV key */
  bindkeys-file "/etc/named.iscdlv.key";

  managed-keys-directory "/var/named/dynamic";
};

include "/etc/named/consul.conf";
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Zone file

Next, set up a zone for your Consul managed records in `consul.conf`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/named/consul.conf">

```dns-zone-file
zone "consul" IN {
  type forward;
  forward only;
  forwarders { 127.0.0.1 port 8600; };
};
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
