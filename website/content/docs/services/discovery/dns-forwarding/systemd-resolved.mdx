# DNS Forwarding with systemd-resolved



## Background

## Requirements

## DNS forwarding

You can use the [`systemd-resolved`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/resolved/) service to resolve local application names in your network. To use the service, configure `systemd-resolved` to send `.consul` domain queries to Consul by creating `consul.conf` file located in the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/ directory.

<Note>

 PTR record queries will still be sent out to the other configured resolvers, in addition to Consul.

</Note>

After creating the resolved configuration, restart `systemd-resolved`.

```shell-session
# systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

### Validate the systemd-resolved configuration

Validate that systemd-resolved has restarted and is configured to forward
queries to Consul.

```shell-session hideClipboard
# systemctl is-active systemd-resolved
active

# resolvectl domain
Global: ~consul
Link 2 (eth0):

# resolvectl query consul.service.consul
consul.service.consul: 127.0.0.1

-- Information acquired via protocol DNS in 6.6ms.
-- Data is authenticated: no
```

Confirm that `/etc/resolv.conf` points to the `stub-resolv.conf` file managed by
systemd-resolved, and that the IP address for systemd-resolved's stub resolver
is the configured `nameserver`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1-2,4,21">

```shell-session
$ ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 37 Aug 20 22:50 /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.
#
# This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the
# internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all
# configured search domains.
#
# Run "resolvectl status" to see details about the uplink DNS servers
# currently in use.
#
# Third party programs must not access this file directly, but only through the
# symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a different way,
# replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.
#
# See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of
# operation for /etc/resolv.conf.

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Ensure that the operating system can resolve DNS queries to the `.consul` domain.

```shell-session
$ host consul.service.consul
consul.service.consul has address 127.0.0.1
```

### Using any local resolver with systemd

By default, the local resolver stub in the `resolved.conf` file is configured to listen for UDP and TCP requests at 127.0.0.53:53, but you can set the `DNSStubListener` option to `false`, which disables the stub. As a result, your system will be able to use any DNS configuration as long as it loads earlier than `resolved`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/systemd/resolved.conf">

```plaintext
DNSStubListener=false
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Disabling the local resolver stub can also solve other DNS configuration issues.
