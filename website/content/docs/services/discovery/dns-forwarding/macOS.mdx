# DNS Forwarding with macOS

## Background

## Requirements

## DNS forwarding


On macOS systems, you can use the macOS system resolver to point all `.consul` requests to Consul.
Documentation for this feature is available via: `man 5 resolver`.
You must add a resolver entry in `/etc/resolver/` to point at Consul. If you do not have this folder, create it.
To configure a resolver entry, you will need sudo/root access. Create a new file `/etc/resolver/consul`,
and add the following text to the file:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/resolver/consul">

```plaintext
nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The configuration informs the macOS resolver daemon to forward all `.consul` TLD requests to 127.0.0.1 on port 8600.
