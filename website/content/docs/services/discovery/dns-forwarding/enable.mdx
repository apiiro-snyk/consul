# Enable DNS forwarding

This topic describes the process to configure different DNS servers to enable DNS forwarding to Consul servers.

The operations performed in this page can be applied on every node where a Consul agent is running.

## Requirements

To enable DNS forwarding, your deployment must have the following:

- A running Consul server instance
- One or more Consul client nodes with services registered in the Consul catalog
- One of the following local DNS servers running, command available, or OS running: 
    - [systemd-resolved](#systemd-resolved)
    - [BIND](#bind)
    - [dnsmasq](#dnsmasq)
    - [Unbound](#unbound)
    - [iptables](#iptables)
    - [macOS](#macos)

<Note>

The configuration assumes Consul's DNS server is listening on the `loopback` interface on the same node of the local DNS server. 
If Consul is not listening on the `loopback` IP, replace the references to `localhost` and `120.0.0.1` in the configuration and commands with the appropriate IP address for your environment.

</Note>

## systemm-resolved

[`systemd-resolved`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/resolved/) is a system service that provides network name resolution to local applications. Is often the default local DNS server for many Linux distributions.

You can configure the `systemd-resolved` service to send `.consul` domain queries to Consul by creating a `consul.conf` file located in the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/` directory.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="systemd 245 and older">

Add the following settings to your resolved configuration file:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/consul.conf">

```ini
[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1
DNSSEC=false
Domains=~consul
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Define port for Consul DNS server

When using systemd 245 and older, you cannot specify port numbers in the `DNS` configuration field. Resolved will only use port `53`, which is a privileged port.

The two possible solutions for this limitation are:
 - [configure Consul DNS service to listen on port `53`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#dns_port) instead of `8600`
 - map port `53` to `8600` using `iptables` 

Binding to port `53` usually requires running Consul as a privileged user or running Linux with the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability. 
When using Consul Docker image, add the following to the environment to allow Consul to use the port: `CONSUL_ALLOW_PRIVILEGED_PORTS=yes`.

To avoid running Consul as a privileged user, the following `iptables` commands are sufficient to map port `53` to `8600`, redirecting DNS queries to Consul.

```shell-session
# iptables --table nat --append OUTPUT --destination localhost --protocol udp --match udp --dport 53 --jump REDIRECT --to-ports 8600 \
  iptables --table nat --append OUTPUT --destination localhost --protocol tcp --match tcp --dport 53 --jump REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="systemd 246 and newer">

Systemd 246 and newer allow you to specify the DNS port directly in the `systemd-resolved` configuration file.
Previous versions of systemd required iptables rules to direct DNS traffic to Consul.

Add the following settings to your resolved configuration file:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/consul.conf">

```ini
[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1:8600
DNSSEC=false
Domains=~consul
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>

PTR record queries will still be sent out to the other configured resolvers, in addition to Consul.

</Note>

After creating the resolved configuration, restart `systemd-resolved`.

```shell-session
# systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

The command produces no output.

### Validate the systemd-resolved configuration

Validate that systemd-resolved  is active. 

```shell-session
# systemctl is-active systemd-resolved
active
```

Verify that `systemd-resolved` is configured to forward queries for the `consul` domain to Consul.

```shell-session
# resolvectl domain
Global: ~consul
Link 2 (eth0):
```

Verify that `systemd-resolved` is able to resolve the Consul server address.

```shell-session
# resolvectl query consul.service.consul
consul.service.consul: 127.0.0.1

-- Information acquired via protocol DNS in 6.6ms.
-- Data is authenticated: no
```

Confirm that `/etc/resolv.conf` points to the `stub-resolv.conf` file managed by `systemd-resolved`. 

```shell-session
$ ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 37 Jul 14 10:10 /etc/resolv.conf -> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
```

Confirm that the IP address for `systemd-resolved`'s stub resolver is the configured `nameserver`.

<CodeBlockConfig>

```shell-session
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
## This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.
##
## This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the
## internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all
## configured search domains.
##
## Run "resolvectl status" to see details about the uplink DNS servers
## currently in use.
##
## Third party programs must not access this file directly, but only through the
## symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a different way,
## replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.
##
## See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of
## operation for /etc/resolv.conf.

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Ensure that the operating system can resolve DNS queries to the `.consul` domain.

```shell-session
$ host consul.service.consul
consul.service.consul has address 127.0.0.1
```

### Using any local resolver with systemd

By default, the local resolver stub in the `resolved.conf` file is configured to listen for UDP and TCP requests at `127.0.0.53:53`, but you can set the `DNSStubListener` option to `false`, which disables the stub. 

As a result, your system will be able to use any DNS configuration as long as it loads earlier than `resolved`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/systemd/resolved.conf">

```plaintext
DNSStubListener=false
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Disabling the local resolver stub can also solve other DNS configuration issues. 

## Dnsmasq

[Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) provides network infrastructure for small networks: DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot. It is designed to be lightweight and have a small footprint.

<Note>

If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

Dnsmasq is typically configured via a `dnsmasq.conf` file or a series of files in the `/etc/dnsmasq.d` directory. Add the following settings to your `dnsmasq` configuration file. In this example we used `/etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul`:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul">

```plaintext
# Enable forward lookup of the 'consul' domain:
server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600

# Uncomment and modify as appropriate to enable reverse DNS lookups for
# common netblocks found in RFC 1918, 5735, and 6598:
#rev-server=0.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=10.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=100.64.0.0/10,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=127.0.0.1/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=169.254.0.0/16,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=172.16.0.0/12,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=192.168.0.0/16,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=224.0.0.0/4,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=240.0.0.0/4,127.0.0.1#8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Restart the `dnsmasq` service after creating the configuration.

You can configure additional settings in `dnsmasq` that may be useful in your environments. 
Refer to [`dnsmasq(8)`](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) for additional details.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/dnsmasq.conf">

```plaintext
# Accept DNS queries only from hosts whose address is on a local subnet.
#local-service

# Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.
#no-poll

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command
# line or the dnsmasq configuration file (see the "server" directive below).
#no-resolv

# Specify IP address(es) of other DNS servers for queries not handled
# directly by consul. There is normally one 'server' entry set for every
# 'nameserver' parameter found in '/etc/resolv.conf'. See dnsmasq(8)'s
# 'server' configuration option for details.
#server=1.2.3.4
#server=208.67.222.222
#server=8.8.8.8

# Set the size of dnsmasq's cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the
# cache size to zero disables caching.
#cache-size=65536
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## BIND

[BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) is a suite of software for interacting with the Domain Name System (DNS). Its most prominent component, `named`, short for name daemon, performs both of the main DNS server roles, acting as an authoritative name server for DNS zones and as a recursive resolver in the network.

<Note>

If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

You can configure the BIND service to send `.consul` domain queries to Consul by:
- creating a configuration file for `named` with `DNSSEC` disables
- creating a configuration for a zone to manage the `.consul` domain 

### Named configuration file

Edit the `/etc/named.conf` to configure your BIND instance. Remember to disable `DNSSEC` so that Consul and BIND can communicate. Also add an `include` section to include the zone file you will create in the following step.

The following example shows a BIND configuration with `DNSSEC` disabled.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/named.conf">

```plaintext
options {
  listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
  listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
  directory       "/var/named";
  dump-file       "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db";
  statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt";
  memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt";
  allow-query     { localhost; };
  recursion yes;

  dnssec-enable no;
  dnssec-validation no;

  /* Path to ISC DLV key */
  bindkeys-file "/etc/named.iscdlv.key";

  managed-keys-directory "/var/named/dynamic";
};

include "/etc/named/consul.conf";
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Zone file

Set up a zone for your Consul managed records in `consul.conf`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/named/consul.conf">

```dns-zone-file
zone "consul" IN {
  type forward;
  forward only;
  forwarders { 127.0.0.1 port 8600; };
};
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Unbound

[Unbound](https://www.unbound.net/) is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards.

<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

Unbound is typically configured in a `unbound.conf` file or in a series of files in the `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d` directory. 

In this example you will use a `consul.conf` file in the `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d` directory.

Add the following settings to your Unbound configuration file:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/consul.conf">

```plaintext
#Allow insecure queries to local resolvers
server:
  do-not-query-localhost: no
  domain-insecure: "consul"

#Add consul as a stub-zone
stub-zone:
  name: "consul"
  stub-addr: 127.0.0.1@8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You may have to add the following line to the bottom of your `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` file for the new configuration to be included.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/unbound/unbound.conf">

```plaintext
include: "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/*.conf"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## iptables

[iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) is a generic firewalling software, part of the netfilter project, that allows you to define traffic rules for your system.

In situations where you don't have a local DNS server on the Consul agent node you can use `iptables` to forward DNS requests on port `53` to the Consul agent running on the same machine without using a secondary service.

This configuration realizes a full DNS forwarding, meaning that all DNS queries for the host will be forwarded to Consul and not only the ones for the `.consul` *Top Level Domain* (TLD). Since Consul by default only resolves the `.consul` TLD you *must* use the [`recursors`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#recursors) flag if you want your node to be able to resolve other domains when using `iptables` configuration.

<Note>

In case you use DNS relay hosts in your network, they _should not_ be on the same host, otherwise the redirects will intercept the traffic.

</Note>

### Configure Consul recursors

To configure recursors for Consul, add the following to your Consul configuration:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/consul.d/consul.hcl">

```hcl
# DNS recursors
recursors = [ "1.1.1.1" ]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Recursors should not include the `localhost` address because the `iptables` redirects would intercept the requests.

You can replace the `1.1.1.1` address in the example with another DNS server address. This is suitable for situations where an external DNS
service is already running in your infrastructure and is used as the recursor.

### Create iptables rules

Once configured Consul to use a valid recursor, add rules to `iptables` to redirect traffic from port `53` to port `8600`: 

```shell-session
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600 \
  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600 \
  iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600 \
  iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d localhost -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8600
```

## macOS

On macOS systems, you can use the macOS system resolver to point all `.consul` requests to Consul.
Documentation for this feature is available via the `man 5 resolver` command.

To configure the macOS system resolver to forward DNS queries to Consul you must add a resolver entry in the `/etc/resolver/` directory that points at the Consul agent. 

If you do not have this folder, create it.

```shell-session
# mkdir -p /etc/resolver
```
 
Create a new file `/etc/resolver/consul`, and add the following text to the file:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/resolver/consul">

```plaintext
nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The configuration informs the macOS resolver daemon to forward all `.consul` TLD requests to `127.0.0.1` on port `8600`.

## Next steps

This guide helped you configure your node DNS to forward requests to Consul.
