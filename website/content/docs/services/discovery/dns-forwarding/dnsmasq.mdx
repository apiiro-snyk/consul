# DNS Forwarding with dnsmasq

## Background

## Requirements

## DNS forwarding



<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

[Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is typically configured via a `dnsmasq.conf` or a series of files in
the `/etc/dnsmasq.d` directory. Add the following settings to your dnsmasq configuration file
(e.g., `/etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul`):

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul">

```plaintext
# Enable forward lookup of the 'consul' domain:
server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600

# Uncomment and modify as appropriate to enable reverse DNS lookups for
# common netblocks found in RFC 1918, 5735, and 6598:
#rev-server=0.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=10.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=100.64.0.0/10,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=127.0.0.1/8,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=169.254.0.0/16,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=172.16.0.0/12,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=192.168.0.0/16,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=224.0.0.0/4,127.0.0.1#8600
#rev-server=240.0.0.0/4,127.0.0.1#8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Restart the `dnsmasq` service after creating the configuration.

You can configure additional settings in `dnsmasq` that may be useful in your environments. See
[`dnsmasq(8)`](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html)
for additional details.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/dnsmasq.conf">

```plaintext
# Accept DNS queries only from hosts whose address is on a local subnet.
#local-service

# Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.
#no-poll

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command
# line or the dnsmasq configuration file (see the "server" directive below).
#no-resolv

# Specify IP address(es) of other DNS servers for queries not handled
# directly by consul. There is normally one 'server' entry set for every
# 'nameserver' parameter found in '/etc/resolv.conf'. See dnsmasq(8)'s
# 'server' configuration option for details.
#server=1.2.3.4
#server=208.67.222.222
#server=8.8.8.8

# Set the size of dnsmasq's cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the
# cache size to zero disables caching.
#cache-size=65536
```
