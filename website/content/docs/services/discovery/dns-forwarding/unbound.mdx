## DNS forwarding


<Note>

 If your distribution uses systemd, you may need to disable `systemd-resolved` prior to following this example. 
 
</Note>

[Unbound](https://www.unbound.net/) is typically configured in a `unbound.conf` file or a series of files in
the `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d` directory. Add the following settings to your Unbound configuration file
(e.g., `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/consul.conf`):

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/consul.conf">

```plaintext
#Allow insecure queries to local resolvers
server:
  do-not-query-localhost: no
  domain-insecure: "consul"

#Add consul as a stub-zone
stub-zone:
  name: "consul"
  stub-addr: 127.0.0.1@8600
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You may have to add the following line to the bottom of your
`/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` file for the new configuration to be included.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/unbound/unbound.conf">

```plaintext
include: "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/*.conf"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
