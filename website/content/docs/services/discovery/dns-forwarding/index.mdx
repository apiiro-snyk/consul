# DNS forwarding

This topic describes the process to configure different DNS servers to enable DNS forwarding to Consul servers.

The operations performed in this page can be applied on every node where a Consul agent is running.

## Introduction

You deployed a Consul datacenter and want to use Consul DNS interface for name resolution.

When configured with default values Consul exposes the DNS interface on port `8600`. By default, DNS is served from port 53. On most operating systems, this requires elevated privileges. It is also common, for most operating systems, to have a local DNS server already running on port `53`.

Instead of running Consul with an administrative or root account, you can forward appropriate queries to Consul, running on an unprivileged port, from another DNS server or using port redirect.

There are two possible configurations for DNS forwarding:
 - *conditional DNS forwarding*: in which the local DNS servers are configured to _foward to Consul_ only queries relative to the `.consul` zone. All other queries are still served via the default DNS server in the node.
 - *DNS forwarding*: in which Consul serves *ALL* DNS queries and _Consul forwards to a remote DNS server_ the ones outside `.consul` domain.

### Conditional DNS forwarding

This is the recommended configuration approach. In this configuration Consul only serves queries relative to the `.consul` domain and there is no unnecessary load on Consul servers to serve queries from dofferent domains.

### DNS forwarding

This approach can be useful in scenarios where the Consul agent nodes have low resources and want to avoid the overhead of running a local DNS server. In this configuration Consul serves all DNS queries for all domains and forwards the ones outside `.consul` domain to one or more configured forwader servers.

This behavior is not enabled by default, Consul standard configuration only resolves DNS record inside the `.consul` zone. To enable DNS forwading you need to set the [recursors](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#recursors) option in your Consul configuration.

In this cenario, if a Consul DNS reply includes a `CNAME` record pointing outside the `.consul` *Top Level Domain* (TLD), then the DNS reply will only include `CNAME` records by default. 

When `recursors` is set and the upstream resolver is functioning correctly, Consul will try to resolve CNAMEs and include any records (e.g., A, AAAA, PTR) for them in its DNS reply. In these scenarios, Consul can be used for full DNS forwarding and is able to serve queries for all domains.

## Workflow

To use DNS forwarding in Consul deployments, complete the following steps:

1. Configure the local DNS service to enable DNS forwarding to Consul. Follow the instructions for one of the following services:
  
    - [systemd-resolved](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding/enable#systemd-resolved)
    - [BIND](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding/enable#bind)
    - [dnsmasq](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding/enable#dnsmasq)
    - [Unbound](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding/enable#unbound)
    - [iptables](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding/enable#iptables)
    - [macOS](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding/enable#macOS)

1. Query the Consul DNS to confirm that DNS forwarding functions correctly.

    ```shell-session
    dig consul.service.consul A
    
    ; <<>> DiG 9.16.48-Debian <<>> consul.service.consul A
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 51736
    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 3, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
    
    ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
    ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;consul.service.consul.		IN	A
    
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    consul.service.consul.	0	IN	A	10.0.4.140
    consul.service.consul.	0	IN	A	10.0.4.121
    consul.service.consul.	0	IN	A	10.0.4.9
    
    ;; Query time: 4 msec
    ;; SERVER: 127.0.0.53#53(127.0.0.53)
    ;; WHEN: Wed Jun 26 20:47:05 UTC 2024
    ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 98
    
    ```

1. Optionally, verify reverse DNS:

    ```shell-session
    $ dig 140.4.0.10.in-addr.arpa. PTR
    
    ; <<>> DiG 9.16.48-Debian <<>> 140.4.0.10.in-addr.arpa. PTR
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 35085
    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
    
    ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
    ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;140.4.0.10.in-addr.arpa.	IN	PTR
    
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    140.4.0.10.in-addr.arpa. 0	IN	PTR	consul-server-0.node.dc1.consul.
    
    ;; Query time: 0 msec
    ;; SERVER: 127.0.0.53#53(127.0.0.53)
    ;; WHEN: Wed Jun 26 20:47:57 UTC 2024
    ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 97
    
    ```
    
    You can use the `short` option for `dig` to only get the node name instead of the full output.

    ```shell-session
    $ dig +short -x 10.0.4.140
    consul-server-0.node.dc1.consul.
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If your DNS server does not respond but you do get an answer from Consul, turn on your DNS server's query log to check for errors.

### systemd-resolved

Enable query logging for `systemd-resolved`:

```shell-session
# resolvectl log-level debug
```

Check query log:

```shell-session
# journalctl -r -u systemd-resolved
```

Disable query logging:

```shell-session
# resolvectl log-level info
```

DNS forwarding may fail if you use the default `systemd-resolved` configuration and attempt to bind to 0.0.0.0. The default configuration uses a DNS stub that listens for UDP and TCP requests at 127.0.0.53. As a result, attempting to bind to 127.0.0.53 conflicts with the running stub. You can disable the stub as described in the [Using any local resolver with systemd](#using-any-local-resolver-with-systemd) section to troubleshoot this problem.

### Dnsmasq

To enable query log refer to [Dnsmasq documentation](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).

In particular look for the `log-queries` and `log-facility` configuration option.

When query log is enabled, it is possible to force Dnsmaqt to emit a full cache dump using the `SIGUSR1` signal.

### BIND

Enable query log:

```shell-session
$ rndc querylog
```

Check logs:
```shell-session
$ tail -f /var/log/messages
```

The log may show errors like this:

```plaintext hideClipboard
error (no valid RRSIG) resolving
error (no valid DS) resolving
```

This indicates that `DNSSEC` is not disabled properly.

If you see errors about network connections, verify that there are no firewall
or routing problems between the servers running BIND and Consul.
